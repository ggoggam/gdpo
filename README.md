## GDPO: GFlowNet Direct Preference Optimization

This is a repository containing the code for [GDPO: Learning to Directly Align Language Models with Diversity Using GFlowNets](https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.951.pdf), published in EMNLP 2024 Main.

### üíª Setup
We highly recommend using [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) as the main package and dependency manager for python.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configurations
For configuration and script arguments, the repository uses [`tyro`](https://brentyi.github.io/tyro).
Refer to `config/__init__.py` for details and arguments.

### 1. Training
Make sure you modify the appropriate `accelerate` config located in `config/accelerate` directory according to your machine configuration. From the `/src` directory, run training by one of the following commands with a choice of machine type.

```shell
uv run accelerate launch --config-file config/accelerate/{type}.yaml train.py ...
# or equivalently
uv run -m accelerate.commands.launch --config-file config/accelerate/{MACHINE_TYPE}.yaml train.py [OPTIONS]
```

For now, we only provide offline training, which was the focus of the paper.

### 2. Generating
Once the training is done, generate responses from a task by running:

```shell
uv run generate.py [OPTIONS]
```

The responses are generated via [`vllm`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm), which provides memory-efficient and resource optimized batched inference.
Hence, it does not need to be run via `accelerate run` command.

### 3. Evaluating
Evaluate on generated responses

```shell
uv run evaluate.py [OPTIONS]
```
